JS22.9: Seatbelt

Objective
Create a unit test for a function that checks if a number is even.

Requirements
Clone the exercise-starters repo, or do a git pull if you already have it.
Find the seatbelt starter code and copy it into a new project folder.
Open test-runner.html in your browser. Read the description of the different files included and take a moment to look at the contents of the files and understand the overall structure of the test suite. You can review the Unit Testing presentation to see a working example of this kind of unit test.
Write your unit test in spec.js. You can "assert" that something is true by calling the desired method and then passing the results to assert, just like in the presentation. The unit test should consist of three assertions:
isEven returns true for an even number
isEven returns false for an odd number
isEven returns true for 0
When completed, you should see three messages in the console that say PASS.
